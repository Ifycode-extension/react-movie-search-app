# React Movie Search App
React movie search app from the scrimba [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/course/greactmovie). course: Build a movie search app in react, and learnt to make a [Spinner/Loader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3L4zQnLrVA) using this resource. My assignment was to connect the fetch to the loading spinner and display error messages when necessary, which i did to the best of my ability (at the moment). I also added a simple footer and designed the app differently. No mockup, just had fun making MY FIRST REACT APP!
